General procedure to follow:	

\begin{itemize}
	\item	Initially include all batches
	
	\item	Build model on all data (usually 2 to 3 components)
	
	\item	Score plot to see if: \hfill {\color{myOrange}{\texttt{plot(model,'scores')}}}
	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	Clusters due to seasonal effect?
				
				\item	Different types of abnormalities (faults) will cluster together.
				
				\item	Different product grade clusters?
				
				\item	Raw material suppler change over groupings?
				
				\item	Outliers? Usually we know which batches were bad.  We usually (always?) start to see bad batches in the scores.
			\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
